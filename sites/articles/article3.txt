Researchers identify 6 types of prediabetes
The study could lead to the development of more personalized interventions that prevent at-risk individuals from
developing type 2 diabetes.  Share on Pinterest Luis Alvarez/Getty Images  People with prediabetes have consistently
high blood sugar levels but have yet to develop the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Over many years, the cells of people
with this condition become increasingly resistant to the effects of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar
levels.  The transition to type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas can no longer compensate for this resistance by
producing more insulin.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 88 million
adults in the United States have prediabetes, which not only increases their risk of type 2 diabetes, but also of heart
disease and stroke.  More than 84% of individuals with prediabetes are unaware that they have it, the CDC report.  For
people with prediabetes, strategies such as losing weight, having a more healthful diet, getting more exercise, and
lowering levels of stress can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 58%.  Among people over 60,
lifestyle changes such as these can reduce the chances of developing diabetes even further, by as much as 71%.  But
people with prediabetes are not a homogenous group. Now, a new study has identified six broad categories, with important
differences in terms of outlook and the kinds of interventions that could delay or prevent diabetes.  Researchers at
various institutions in Germany, including the University of TÃ¼bingen and the German Center for Diabetes Research, in
Neuherberg, led the study, which has been published in Nature Medicine.
