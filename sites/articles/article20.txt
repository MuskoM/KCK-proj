Plant-based diet could boost metabolism
For people who may wish to lose weight, plant-based diets could be the best solution thanks to the way in which they
influence metabolism.  Share on Pinterest Image credit: Alexander Spatari/Getty Images  That is the takeaway from a
recent study published in the JAMA Network Open.  According to the research results, switching to a low fat, plant-based
diet could boost the body’s metabolism enough to burn excess weight and fat — even without vigorous exercise.
Researchers with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) partnered with Dr. Kitt Petersen and Dr.
Gerald Shulman of Yale University. Together, they conducted a 16-week trial where participants in the intervention group
adopted a low fat, vegan diet.  The study team hoped to find the full impact of a low fat, vegan diet. Could it improve
metabolism, reduce visceral fat, and aid in significant weight loss?  Initially, 3,115 people responded to the flyers
distributed by the research team. Of these, 244 met the criteria for participation in the study.  Eligible study
participants had overweight, with body mass indexes ranging between 28 and 40, and were aged 25–75.  Researchers
randomly split the study participants into two groups. The first group followed a 4-month-long low fat, vegan diet,
eating fruits, vegetables, pulses, and grains in serving sizes comparable to what they ordinarily consumed at mealtimes.
The second group, functioning as the control group, did not change their dietary habits.  Members of both groups curbed
their daily alcohol consumption for the duration of the study. Women could drink a single alcoholic beverage daily,
while men could have up to two drinks per day. Neither group began an exercise routine or deviated from any existing
physical habits during the 16-week trial.
