Apathy may precede dementia years before other symptoms
A study has found that in individuals at genetic risk of frontotemporal dementia, apathy predicts the development of
symptoms years later. Targeting early signs of apathy may be one way to delay the onset of this type of dementia or slow
its progression.  Share on Pinterest Darren Robb/Getty Images  Doctors usually diagnose frontotemporal dementia in
people between the ages of 45 and 64 years, and this condition accounts for fewer than 1 in 20 dementia cases. It mainly
affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.  The disease has a genetic component; around 10–30% of all people
with this type of dementia have a family history of it.  Unlike more common forms of dementia, which tend to affect
older people, early frontotemporal dementia causes behavior, personality, and language changes in people who retain
their spatial skills and memory.  Behavioral symptoms include a loss of usual inhibitions, repetitive or compulsive
behaviors, decreased energy, and apathy or listlessness.  Individuals with this condition may lose their motivation,
initiative, and interests, leading to the mistaken impression that they are depressed.  The new study cites previous
findings that apathy, one of the most common symptoms of the disease, is associated with a poorer overall outcome.  “It
is linked to functional decline, decreased quality of life, loss of independence, and poorer survival,” explains the
lead author of the new study, Maura Malpetti, a doctoral student in clinical neurosciences at the University of
Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.  Apathy tends to appear several years before a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.
Malpetti and her colleagues wanted to find out whether apathy is an early sign of the disease and whether it is
associated with changes in the brain before the onset of other symptoms.  “The more we discover about the earliest
effects of frontotemporal dementia, when people still feel well in themselves, the better we can treat symptoms and
delay or even prevent the dementia,” says Malpetti.  The researchers report their findings in the journal Alzheimer’s &
Dementia.
