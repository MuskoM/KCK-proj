Health threat of plastics outlined in authoritative report
Researchers have highlighted how exposure to plastics can disrupt a person’s endocrine system, causing serious health
issues. Share on Pinterest Image credit: Group4 Studio/Getty Images In a newly published authoritative report,
scientists on behalf of the Endocrine Society and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) have outlined
the various ways exposure to plastics can disrupt a person’s endocrine system. The report presents the latest research
on the types of chemicals that can cause health problems and the plastic products that typically contain them.
Endocrine disruption According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the endocrine system describes the various
components of a person’s body that govern or respond to a person’s hormones. These include glands found in various
locations in a person’s body, the hormones that these glands secrete, and the organs affected by these hormones. There
is mounting evidence that a disruption of this system can have severe consequences for a person’s health. A person’s
endocrine system can be disrupted through exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Researchers have shown that
these can intensify or directly cause many conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and
some types of cancer.  EDCs The present report highlights that, at a conservative estimate, there are more than 1,000
chemicals widely used today that can disrupt a person’s endocrine system. These chemicals are typically present in
plastics that can then leech into a person’s body. Plastics containing EDCs are found extensively throughout the world,
including in packaging, food production, cookware, healthcare settings, children’s toys, furniture, electrical goods,
textiles, cosmetics, and vehicles. Further, a person can be exposed to EDCs throughout the life span of a plastic
product, including its manufacture, use, and eventual disposal. The report’s lead author Prof. Jodi Flaws, of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Urbana, explained: “Many of the plastics we use every day at home and work
are exposing us to a harmful cocktail of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Definitive action is needed on a global level
to protect human health and our environment from these threats.”  Better control of EDCs? The report is preceded by a
foreword from Franz Xaver Perrez, the Swiss Ambassador for the Environment. In May 2020, Switzerland submitted a
proposal to the Stockholm Convention — a global instrument for controlling hazardous chemicals — to recognize the
ultraviolet stabilizer and plastic additive UV-328 as dangerous to health. According to Perrez, “It is our collective
responsibility to enact public policies to address the clear evidence that EDC in plastics are hazards threatening
public health and our future.” Despite the growing evidence on the harmful effects of EDCs, regulations on their use
have so far been limited.  An increasing burden In addition to the current burden that EDCs place on human health, the
report is particularly urgent given the projections suggesting a significant increase in the near future in the
manufacture of plastics that contain them. According to Pamela Miller, IPEN co-chair, “This report clarifies that the
current acceleration of plastic production, projected to increase by 30–36% in the next 6 years, will greatly exacerbate
EDC exposures and rising global rates of endocrine diseases.” She added: “Global policies to reduce and eliminate EDCs
from plastic and reduce exposures from plastic recycling, plastic waste, and incineration are imperative. EDCs in
plastics are an international health issue that is felt acutely in the global south, where toxic plastic waste shipments
from wealthier countries inundate communities.”
