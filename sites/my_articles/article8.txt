Drought may increase females' HIV risk in developing nations
A modeling study suggests that females in developing nations are especially vulnerable to the effects of drought and
food shortages. The social, economic, and medical consequences may disproportionately increase their risk of contracting
HIV.  Share on Pinterest Image credit: James O’Neil/Getty Images.  When HIV emerged in the 1980s and 90s, males were
more likely than females to contract the virus. However, globally, the majority of adults living with HIV are now
females, according to United Nations data.  The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) report that HIV is the
leading cause of death in females aged 30–49 years and the third leading cause of females in females aged 15–29 years
globally.  The relative rates of males and females contracting HIV vary widely between countries, but data from the
World Bank suggest that in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, more than 60% of all those living with HIV are females.
Females aged 15–24 in this region of Africa are more than twice as likely as males in the same age bracket to become HIV
positive, according to UNAIDS.  What makes females in developing countries so much more vulnerable to contracting HIV
than males?  Research by Kelly Austin, associate professor of sociology at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA, and her
colleagues suggests that droughts are one contributory factor.  Their study, which appears in the journal Social
Indicators Research, found that food insecurity resulting from droughts has a disproportionate effect on females’ risk
of contracting HIV.
